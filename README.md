This is a fork of the EagleEye project, ported to Android Studio.
To run, first install the Xposed framework on your android phone (root required). Then install the apk from android studio, enable the xposed module, and restart your phone. Now you can instrument applications as per usual EagleEye functionality.

This project will expand significantly on EagleEye. For notes and instrumentation steps, see projectNotes/.
