		for nexus 7, make sure it's ending in "flo"
		**** Because these nexus 7's were shipped with android 5.0 lollipop, and twrp original image was made for kit kat (4.4),
			the regular recovery images won't work. Get the multirom TWRP for flo and flash that instead

	once it shows that it's flashed in term, use power and volume buttons in bootloader page to go to "recovery"

	If you want to install a zip, go into advanced, sideload with adb
	I unchecked "inject multirom after installation"
	in term, adb sideload xposed.zip
	then after you reboot, adb install xposed_installer.apk (make sure you uninstall any prev versions first)
