code ex path

android:
	init.rc boots the os
		calls /system/bin/app_process
			loads needed classes, invokes init methods

xposed: 
	install framework as root
	copy modified app_process into /system/bin 
		https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed/blob/master/xposed.cpp#L315
		https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed/blob/master/xposed.cpp#L369
		https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed/blob/master/app_main.cpp#L256		
		https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed/blob/master/app_main.cpp#L258

		this jar is added to the classpath (XposedBridge.jar)
			https://github.com/rovo89/XposedBridge/blob/master/src/de/robv/android/xposed/XposedBridge.java
				main -> initXbridgeZygote() -> hook methods 

eagleeye:
	register as xposed module in AndroidManifest.xml
	add init class in app/src/main/assets/xposed_init
		points to app/src/main/java/Tutorial
			-> overwrites hookSystemApis()
				-> hookAll() -> hook() -> creates new XC_MethodHook and calls XposedBridge.hookMethod()
					https://github.com/rovo89/XposedBridge/blob/master/src/de/robv/android/xposed/XposedBridge.java#L506
						-> hookMethodNative()

	when a method is called that's defined in Tutorial.hookSystemApis(),
	https://github.com/MindMac/AndroidEagleEye/blob/master/EagleEye/src/com/mindmac/eagleeye/service/Launcher.java#L94
	we go to the java class defined for that hook
	i.e. ContentResolverHook: hookAll(ContentResolverHook.getMethodHookList()); in app/src/main/hookclass/ContentResolverHook
		https://github.com/MindMac/AndroidEagleEye/blob/master/EagleEye/src/com/mindmac/eagleeye/hookclass/ContentResolverHook.java
		extends MethodHook, which is the EagleEye hooking object
			-> before() gets called before the method runs. This is because in Tutorial.hook(), the XC_MethodHook obj we make is instantiated with methodHook.before(param) for its beforeHookedMethod (Tutorial line 398)
				-> modify data there
