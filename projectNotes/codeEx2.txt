1. where exactly does xposed look up and call the hooks defined by eagleeye?
2. how does xposed/eagleeye check which uids to hook?

Important links:
	JNIEnv->RegisterNatives() http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1010645/what-does-the-registernatives-method-do

Registering the callback:

	overwritten app_process: onStarted
		AndroidRuntime->callMain() https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed/blob/653c5eaf7281c9c8a6d981106d084cc98059544d/app_main2.cpp#L97
			XpsoedBridge->main()

	XposedBridge.main calls-> loadModules() -> 
	XposedBridge.loadModule()
		Loads our xposed module 
		Reads in the class name in assets/xposed_init (i.e. Tutorial)
		Sees what it implements
		For all instances of IXposedMods it implements, do stuff
		https://github.com/rovo89/XposedBridge/blob/da5483c12ee5e436a945e0bdb352bf30389bb410/src/de/robv/android/xposed/XposedBridge.java#L483
			call our module's Tutorial's initZygote()
				Calls some stuff
				Calls hookSystemApis() -> hookAll -> hook()
					-> XposedBridge.hookMethod()

	XposedBridge.hookMethod()
		https://github.com/rovo89/XposedBridge/blob/da5483c12ee5e436a945e0bdb352bf30389bb410/src/de/robv/android/xposed/XposedBridge.java#L542
		Registers a callback object for a method
			callbacks = sHookedMethodCallbacks.get(hookMethod)
			callbacks.add(callback)
			AdditionalHookInfo additionalInfo = new AdditionalHookInfo(callbacks, parameterTypes, returnType);
			hookMethodNative(hookMethod, declaringClass, slot, additionalInfo);


Passing control to the register callbacks:

	XposedInstaller installs a custom app_process
		Writes "arm/" + "app_process_xposed_sdk" to "bin/app_process"
			https://github.com/rovo89/XposedInstaller/blob/cdb3f47895f5543eca0ff94861f5a98b343213c6/src/de/robv/android/xposed/installer/util/AssetUtil.java#L23
		https://github.com/rovo89/XposedInstaller/blob/cdb3f47895f5543eca0ff94861f5a98b343213c6/src/de/robv/android/xposed/installer/InstallerFragment.java#L627
		https://github.com/rovo89/XposedInstaller/blob/cdb3f47895f5543eca0ff94861f5a98b343213c6/src/de/robv/android/xposed/installer/InstallerFragment.java#L692
		AssetUtil.writeAssetToFile() pretty much writes the bytes from the specified file to the location we want to install in. 
			https://github.com/rovo89/XposedInstaller/blob/cdb3f47895f5543eca0ff94861f5a98b343213c6/src/de/robv/android/xposed/installer/util/AssetUtil.java#L54
	Where's the code of app_process? 
		arm/app_process_xposed_sdk
	what is the high level code that compiles to this? idk why there's two, I think the second one is much more recent though
		https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed/blob/6a8c2db5523377742a2c40fbd317b559e46b386f/app_main.cpp
		https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed/blob/653c5eaf7281c9c8a6d981106d084cc98059544d/app_main2.cpp

	app_main2.cpp overwrites android's original app_process
		https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/core/jni/AndroidRuntime.cpp
	it also defines a onVmCreated, which calls xposed:onVmCreated
		https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed/blob/6a8c2db5523377742a2c40fbd317b559e46b386f/libxposed_dalvik.cpp#L47
		This finds the XposedBridge class, and calls register_natives_XposedBridge (line 81)
			https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed/blob/653c5eaf7281c9c8a6d981106d084cc98059544d/libxposed_common.cpp#L286
			This registers some native methods according to JNIEnv->RegisterNatives 
				pretty much defines (registers in the JVM env) the native methods in XposedBridge such as hookMethodNative() and initNative()
				http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1010645/what-does-the-registernatives-method-do

	main function of XposedBridge
		https://github.com/rovo89/XposedBridge/blob/da5483c12ee5e436a945e0bdb352bf30389bb410/src/de/robv/android/xposed/XposedBridge.java#L88
		calls loadModules() and initNative()
			initNative() is the native function that we added to the JVM env with register_natives_XposedBridge
				https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed/blob/653c5eaf7281c9c8a6d981106d084cc98059544d/libxposed_common.cpp#L78
				calls https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed/blob/6a8c2db5523377742a2c40fbd317b559e46b386f/libxposed_dalvik.cpp#L165

	Xposed.libxposed_dalvik.callback_XposedBridge_initNative
		makes sure XposedBridge.handleHookedMethod exists
		makes sure XposedBridge.invokeOriginalMethodNative exists
		adds Xposed.libxposed_davlik.XposedBridge_invokeOriginalMethodNative to the env
		So now invokeOriginalMethodNative and hookMethodNative native methods are defined for XposedBridge
			note that hookMethodNative was called from (XposedBridge.main -> loadModule() -> hookMethod())

	hookMethodNative()
		https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed/blob/6a8c2db5523377742a2c40fbd317b559e46b386f/libxposed_dalvik.cpp#L289
		EagleEye -> tutorial -> hookall -> hook -> pass in registered callback code to XposedBridge.hookMethod
			-> calledback code is passed in to hookMethodNative as the last parameter (Object additionalInfo)
		Replaces the method with the callback code
			https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed/blob/6a8c2db5523377742a2c40fbd317b559e46b386f/libxposed_dalvik.cpp#L316
			Method method = dvmSlotToMethod()
			method->nativeFunc = &hookedMethodCallback
				hookedMethodCallback populates the feilds for XposedBridge's XC_MethodHook class
				calls the function handler https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed/blob/6a8c2db5523377742a2c40fbd317b559e46b386f/libxposed_dalvik.cpp#L262
					dvmCallMethod
						https://android.googlesource.com/platform/dalvik/+/tools_r21/vm/interp/Stack.cpp#424
				returns the return value

Tracking UIDs
	Registering:
		Tutorial.handleLoadPackage -> Util.storeFrameworkLogAppUids()
		Tutorial.handleLoadPackage is called when the xposed module is loaded
			XposedBridge.loadModules: https://github.com/rovo89/XposedBridge/blob/art/src/de/robv/android/xposed/XposedBridge.java#L487
				hookLoadPackage -> sLoadedPackageCallbacks.add(callback);
		XposedBridge.initForZygote adds the callbacks when zygote is started
			https://github.com/rovo89/XposedBridge/blob/art/src/de/robv/android/xposed/XposedBridge.java#L235
			calls hookAllConstructors -> hookMethod
				https://github.com/rovo89/XposedBridge/blob/art/src/de/robv/android/xposed/XposedBridge.java#L542
				calls hookMethodNative

Checking:
	Tutorial.handleLoadPackage -> Util.isAppNeedFrLog() (if not, don't hook)
		dvmMethods() library in libxposed_dalvik.cp
	https://android.googlesource.com/platform/dalvik/+/tools_r21/vm/Jni.cpp
Method class
	https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed/blob/6a8c2db5523377742a2c40fbd317b559e46b386f/libxposed_dalvik.h
	includes it from Dalvik.h
		https://android.googlesource.com/platform/dalvik/+/tools_r21/vm/Dalvik.h
		includes Object.h
			https://android.googlesource.com/platform/dalvik/+/6d874d2bda563ada1034d2b3219b35d800fc6860/vm/oo/Object.h
			struct method
				https://android.googlesource.com/platform/dalvik/+/6d874d2bda563ada1034d2b3219b35d800fc6860/vm/oo/Object.h#418
				has nativeFunc field


Questions
	Dalvik / art reflection
		references for reflection
	Object.getsnapshot()
		when you get the snapshot, what are the values of the enviornmental var's? and at what time
	dvmSetNativeFunc
		where is it?
	https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed/blob/6a8c2db5523377742a2c40fbd317b559e46b386f/libxposed_dalvik.cpp#L312
		why are they using a memcpy?

	We don't need to take the class as an argument because, in Dalvik, we don't need to worry about static synchronized methods.
	https://android.googlesource.com/platform/dalvik/+/tools_r21/vm/interp/Stack.cpp#424
 		why?

	can we rebuild / recompile the dalvik vm?
		put a debug statement to see that every method hook goes through a native function dereference
