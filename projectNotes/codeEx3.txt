Questions
	Dalvik / art reflection
		references for reflection
	Object.getsnapshot()
		when you get the snapshot, what are the values of the enviornmental var's? and at what time
	dvmSetNativeFunc
		where is it?
	https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed/blob/6a8c2db5523377742a2c40fbd317b559e46b386f/libxposed_dalvik.cpp#L312
		why are they using a memcpy?

	We don't need to take the class as an argument because, in Dalvik, we don't need to worry about static synchronized methods.
	https://android.googlesource.com/platform/dalvik/+/tools_r21/vm/interp/Stack.cpp#424
 		why?

	can we rebuild / recompile the dalvik vm?
		put a debug statement to see that every method hook goes through a native function dereference

    milestones:

    log hooking system
        1. API level (binder api level)
        2. VM level (dalvik code hook)
            print out context (env vars, who is talking to who, what's in the message)

    develop filtering language
        how do we filter?
